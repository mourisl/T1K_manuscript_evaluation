## The scripts and results to generate the ground truth from HPRC phased genomes
- Genome: the genotyping results extracted from HPRC phased genomes. These files are generated by the script "GenotypeHPRC.sh" .
- Illumina: the genotyping results from T1K.

### Evaluation
To generate corresponding evaluation results, just run `perl Compare{func}.pl sample_list.out`
- CompareBwaExon.pl : evaluate whether the gene in each sample predicted from T1K can be matched
- CompareGeneBwaExon.pl : Summarize the gene-level precision of T1K
- CompareBwaExonRecall.pl : evaluate the sensitivity of T1K
- CompareVcf.pl : evaluate the precision of SNP calling from T1K
- CompareVcfRecall.pl : evaluate the sensitivity of SNP calling from T1K
